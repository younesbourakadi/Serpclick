# SerpClixBotSearcher
This bot allows you to get passive income from SerpClix. Each click is usually $0.10 (sometimes $0.05 if offer isnt from the US).
Over a few days of testing, the average income from this bot is $12.00 a day, which is about $0.50 an hour. This is $360 a month of free passive income.

The bot works by automattically clicking offers as they come up and searching for the offer. When it finds it on the page, it'll scan the page and click on it.

Currently map and image offers are not supported but will be added in a future update.

To get started, follow the steps below.

Install these libraries:
pip install pywin32
pip install keyboard
pip install pyautogui
pip install opencv-python


Then open the .py file and make changes to the variables.

You need to have two tabs open, first tab is the 'my earnings page', and the second tab is the offers page.

Enjoy :)
